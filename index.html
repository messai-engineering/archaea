<a id="why-archaea-" class="anchor" href="#why-archaea-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Archaea ?</h1>

<h1>
<a id="the-question" class="anchor" href="#the-question" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Question</h1>

<p>Machine learning has been solving problems that once been only portrayed in science fictions. When it comes to human alike thinking and artificial intelligence Machine learning is the farthest humanity has reached.All major machine learning algorithm implementations are with big-shots like Google and Microsoft.So here is the question <em>"What if you wanna create an application which uses machine learning ?"</em>. What are the possible solutions currently available. Lets list out a few options and see how feasible are they.</p>

<h2>
<a id="learn-from-scratch-and-implement" class="anchor" href="#learn-from-scratch-and-implement" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Learn from Scratch and Implement</h2>

<p>This is the first Option that comes to everyone's mind. That means you have to have some good interest in machine learning algorithms and pretty good experience with Mathematics especially statistics. Provided these it will require good amount of time and patience to find the right materials and learn the entire concept.</p>

<h2>
<a id="use-some-of-the-existing-libraries-like-pybrain-or-sci-learn" class="anchor" href="#use-some-of-the-existing-libraries-like-pybrain-or-sci-learn" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Use some of the existing libraries like PyBrain or Sci-Learn.</h2>

<p>Yes, provided you have enough patience and will to work this is a good solutions. But this might make you send lot of time understanding code and setting up the variables. Most of the parameters that the library requires us to provide would be unknown. By the time you come up with your app, someone else might have already released there.</p>

<h2>
<a id="hiring-a-machine-learning-expert-and-make-him-deliver-the-code" class="anchor" href="#hiring-a-machine-learning-expert-and-make-him-deliver-the-code" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hiring a Machine Learning Expert and make him deliver the code.</h2>

<p>This is the probably the solution if you have enough money. The current market value of a Machine Learning expert is huge and wouldn't be economical to use such a service as your ROI will be effected significantly.</p>

<h2>
<a id="deployment" class="anchor" href="#deployment" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Deployment</h2>

<p>After all these efforts you have your code ready and trained. Now here comes deployment costs.</p>

<p>There can be couple of other solutions too, but am not listing them all. The best cost effective solution to all these problems is <strong>Archaea</strong>.</p>

<a id="whats-archaea-" class="anchor" href="#whats-archaea-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's Archaea ?</h1>

<a id="lets-think-of-possible-solutions" class="anchor" href="#lets-think-of-possible-solutions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lets Think of Possible Solutions</h1>

<p>What can be the most cost effective solution for this problem. How can you solve this in a general way. That's what archaea is all about. We come with PaaS for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<h2>
<a id="why-paas-" class="anchor" href="#why-paas-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why PaaS ?</h2>

<p>Why Platform as a Service is becoming more and more popular amoung the app development industry ? The answer is abstraction, the app developer has to think of just there application logic rather than complex machine learning algorithms. This gives the complete end to end solution on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
